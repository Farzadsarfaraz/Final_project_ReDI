🏨 Final Project – ReDI School
"Find Your Hotel Room Floor"

This is a very basic Python project that helps users find the correct floor number of their room in a 20-storey hotel.

🗣️ To make it more interactive, I used the pyttsx3 library, which allows the computer to speak the floor number out loud.
